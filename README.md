**1. Introduction**                                                                                                 
Currently, 3D structure acquisition of real objects is a digital storage and recording technology that has various application requirements in scientific and engineering fields such as object modeling, scene modeling, realistic rendering, robot navigation, target recognition, and 3D measurement. Technology-based research in computer vision will be applied in this study based on 3D reconstruction techniques and trajectory trajectories based on paths and pose estimations which have great theoretical research value and are significant in practical applications, this study uses visual odometry by estimating the beginning of the camera odometry change to each poses, and each visual odometry group was estimated to have a different scale.
